# Firebase Local Dev 

Run [./setupDev.sh](setupDev.sh) to build Docker image and run container with Firebase Emulator.

Currently, only firestore emulator is run along with the UI. To check the ports configured, see [firebase.json](firebase/firebase.json) file.

Open http://0.0.0.0:4000 on your host machine and you should see the Firebase Emulator UI.
